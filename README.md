MillionSongRecommender
======================

Various recommender systems made using the 'million song' dataset. The purpose of this endeavour is to experiment with various research ideas for my work with Mu Zhu in summer 2014. 
More specifically, I'll be looking at ways to improve current matrix factorization techniques, and using this dataset to give feedback on the quality of my ideas, and build some intuition.
